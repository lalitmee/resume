# My Resume

This resume is created using [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)
which is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter**
inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv).
It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written
by a clean, semantic markup.

You can see my resume's PDF [here](/resume.pdf)
